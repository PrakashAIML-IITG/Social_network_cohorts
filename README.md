MINI PROJECT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Project Title: Unveiling Cohorts(segments) in Social Networks

2. Description: Briefly explain the purpose of the project, such as analyzing social network data to uncover user cohorts and patterns.

     Develop a system that automatically analyzes social media networks to identify and cluster communities, providing actionable insights that help businesses:

     Audience Segmentation: Identify clusters of users with similar interests, behaviors, or demographics for targeted marketing strategies.

     Influencer Identification: Discover influential users within specific communities to enhance influencer marketing efforts.

     Community Engagement: Understand social network structures and user interactions to foster genuine community engagement and build brand trust.

4. Features:
     Utilizing features extracted from social network data, including degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, average neighbor 
     degree, PageRank, 2-hop degree, and 3-hop degree, to identify distinct user cohorts using KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms.

6. Installation:
     Dependencies: List the external libraries or packages required to run your code. For example:

      NumPy
      pandas
      scikit-learn
      matplotlib
      seaborn
   Certain module like optuna , it needs to be installed using pip( example: !pip install optuna) and for rest python packages it can be imported using.

8. Usage:
     You can simply open the Unveiling_Cohorts_in_Social_Networks_Mini_Project.ipynb file in colab or jupyternotebook or vscode to use it.
     While you are running if encounter any module import issue make sure you install that specif module in the respective IDE that you are using.

10. Data Sources:
    Dataset can be downloaded https://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook_combined.txt.gz. unzip it and upload in your google drive if you are using google colab as runtime 
    platform for coding

11. Documentation:
      python documentation
      matplotlib, pandas and seaborn documentaion (https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html, https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html, https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
      scikit-learn documentation for clustering, feature engineering ( e.g https://scikit-learn.org/stable/unsupervised_learning.html)
